# Loading Firmware


## Prerequisites

* [cc-debugger](http://www.ti.com/tool/cc-debugger)
* linux machine (or VM) with sdcc and cc-tool (to program cc1110)
* windows machine (or VM) with BLE Bluegiga SW Update Tool

*Note:* Be careful to write the appropriate firmware to the correct chip.  If you write the cc1110 firmware to the ble113, you will wipe out the ble113 license key and will need to request a new one from Bluegiga
